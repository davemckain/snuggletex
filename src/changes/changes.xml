    <release version="1.2.0-beta1" date="2009-11-26" description="Version 1.2.0 (SVN revision 517)">
      <action dev="davemckain" type="add" date="2009-11-24">
        Added ErrorGroup interface and implementations to group related ErrorCodes together.
        Error Codes documentation page updated to use this concept.
      </action>
      <action dev="davemckain" type="update" date="2009-11-23">
        Added support for $f^{-1}$ and $f^2$ in Content MathML to Maxima up-conversion stylesheet.
      </action>
      <action dev="davemckain" type="fix" date="2009-11-13">
        WebPageOutputOptionsTemplates now sets content type correctly when generating MOZILLA pages.
      </action>
      <action dev="davemckain" type="update" date="2009-10-30">
        Web page builder now always adds xml:lang attribute when generating XHTML or XML outputs.
      </action>
      <action dev="davemckain" type="update" date="2009-10-30">
        Changed public/system identifiers to -//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.1 plus MathML 2.0//EN
        and http://www.w3.org/TR/MathML2/dtd/xhtml-math11-f.dtd when generating web pages
        of type CROSS_BROWSER_XHTML.
      </action>
      <action dev="davemckain" type="fix" date="2009-10-30">
        SnuggleTeX was incorrectly creating 'accent' attributes instead of 'accentunder'
        attributes when creating munder elements.
      </action>
      <action dev="davemckain" type="update" date="2009-08-03">
        Extracted the parts of XMLStringOutputOptions pertaining to XML serialization to an
        interface called SerializationOptions, with a "standalone" implementation that
        replaces and simplifies the various overloaded serialization methods in MathMLUtilities
        and friends. Most of these existing methods have been kept for the time being, but
        marked as deprecated. Also did some further tidying to StylesheetManager, moving some
        code previously in XMLUtilities here where it can be more easily managed.
        Finally, the demo webapp now outputs named entities in MathML source
        fragments, which is more useful for demonstration purposes.
      </action>
      <action dev="davemckain" type="fix" date="2009-08-03">
        Fixed overly permissive handling of extraneous '$' characters when parsing math mode.
        <fixes issue="2831470"/>
      </action>
      <action dev="davemckain" type="fix" date="2009-07-27">
        Fixed the Unicode characters emitted within the resulting MathML for
        \cdot, \bullet, \diamond and \frown.
      </action>
      <action dev="davemckain" type="add" date="2009-07-27">
        Added TransformerFactoryChooser interface that allows users with exacting requirements
        to control the choice of XSLT 1.0 (and 2.0, where required) processors. A default
        implementation is provided that uses the standard JAXP TransformerFactoryImpl search,
        and there's also one which picks Saxon 9.X in all circumstances.
      </action>
      <action dev="davemckain" type="update" date="2009-07-21">
        Improved the mechanism for adding custom built-in commands and environments.
        The old DefinitionMap has been renamed as SnugglePackage and moved to top package.
        Each SnugglePackage can have its own error codes and message bundles.
        A "core" package now provides the functionality for the core module, and the
        old ErrorCode enumeration has been split into an interface of the same name and
        a CoreErrorCodes enumeration. The up-conversion functionality and error codes have
        been moved into a separate package, which can be accessed via the
        UpConversionPackageDefinitions class.
      </action>
      <action dev="davemckain" type="update" date="2009-07-17">
        W3C-related constants have been moved out of the Globals class and now use
        either the standard XMLConstants or new W3CContants classes.
      </action>
      <action dev="davemckain" type="add" date="2009-07-17">
        Added first cut of new \assume command that will be used to control aspects of
        the up-conversion process.
      </action>
      <action dev="davemckain" type="add" date="2009-07-17">
        Enhanced DOMOutputOptions to allow caller to specify whether to use
        namespace prefixes for XHTML and SnuggleTeX XML elements.
      </action>
      <action dev="davemckain" type="add" date="2009-07-16">
        Added very simple mechanism for getting and setting variables, which will
        be used for "assume" functionality to make up-conversion more customisable.
      </action>
      <action dev="davemckain" type="update" date="2009-07-15">
        Renamed SnuggleSession.getCommandByTeXName() as getBuiltinCommandByTeXName(), and
        similarly the version for environments. These methods are likely to have been used by
        very few people.
      </action>
      <action dev="davemckain" type="add" date="2009-07-15">
        Added new XMLStringOutputOptions Object, sitting between DOMOutputOptions and WebPageOutputOptions.
        New versions of SnuggleSession.buildXMLString() have been added to reflect this; the existing
        ones are now deprecated and will be removed at the next major release.
      </action>
      <action dev="davemckain" type="add" date="2009-07-03">
        Math Input Demo now shows both MathML rendering and XHTML+CSS/image renderings
        of the results, which might be useful for comparison purposes.
      </action>
      <action dev="davemckain" type="add" date="2009-07-02">
        Added support for the AMS-LaTeX cases, matrix, pmatrix, bmatrix, Bmatrix, vmatrix and Vmatrix environments.
      </action>
      <action dev="davemckain" type="fix" date="2009-07-02">
        Up-conversion process now generates MathML using the same namespace prefix
        as the original Presentation MathML produced by SnuggleTeX.
      </action>
      <action dev="davemckain" type="add" date="2009-07-02">
        Changed the characters for left and right angle brackets to U+2329 and U+232A
        respectively.
      </action>
      <action dev="davemckain" type="add" date="2009-07-02">
        Added missing support for '\left.' and '\right.'
        <fixes issue="2814534"/>
      </action>
      <action dev="davemckain" type="add" date="2009-07-02">
        Internal refactoring of the Interpretation class hierarchy, to make it easier for
        commands and tokens to have multiple meanings. The old MathMLOperator enumeration
        has been replaced with a more general set of constants defining various MathML symbols.
        (Note that if you have been defining your own BuiltinCommand and BuiltinEnvironment
        instances, then you will need to change them slightly. The vast majority of users will
        not have been doing this as the process is not documented - contact me for help if this
        is not the case for you and you can't work out what to do!)
      </action>
      <action dev="davemckain" type="add" date="2009-06-25">
        Up-conversion process now includes an XPath expression within the <![CDATA[<s:fail/>]]>
        element to help locate where the failure occurred.
      </action>
      <action dev="davemckain" type="add" date="2009-06-23">
        Filled in gap in support for optional arguments in user-defined commands and
        environments.
        <fixes issue="2810332"/>
      </action>
    </release>
    <release version="1.1.0" date="2009-06-19" description="Version 1.1.0 (SVN revision 428)">
      <action dev="davemckain" type="update" date="2009-06-19">
        Improved structure of the "full" distribution bundle, also fixing a couple of issues
        with the way Maven was assembling it.
      </action>
      <action dev="davemckain" type="update" date="2009-06-19">
        Renamed UCExxx and UMExxx error codes as UCFxxx and UMFxxx respectively, to
        reflect the fact that they are not handled as errors in the normal way.
      </action>
      <action dev="davemckain" type="update" date="2009-06-19">
        Improved logging in the demo/documentation webapp.

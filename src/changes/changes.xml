      <action dev="davemckain" type="add" date="2009-07-02">
        Internal refactoring of the Interpretation class hierarchy, to make it easier for
        commands and tokens to have multiple meanings. The old MathMLOperator enumeration
        has been replaced with a more general set of constants defining various MathML symbols.
        (Note that if you have been defining your own BuiltinCommand and BuiltinEnvironment
        instances, then you will need to change them slightly. The vast majority of users will
        not have been doing this as the process is not documented - contact me for help if this
        is not the case for you and you can't work out what to do!)

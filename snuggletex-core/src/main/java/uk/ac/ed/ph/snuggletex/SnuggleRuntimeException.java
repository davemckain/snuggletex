/**
 * This {@link RuntimeException} is used to indicate a problem within SnuggleTeX which is due to
 * a mis-configuration of SnuggleTeX, rather than a problem with client input or bad logic within
 * SnuggleTeX.
 * <p>
 * I have made this an unchecked Exception since these types of problems are not likely to occur
 * in normal circumstances and software interacting with SnuggleTeX is perhaps unlikely to be able
 * to fix the situation without some work, so the burden of having to declare these types of
 * Exceptions is avoided.
 *  
 * <h2>SnuggleTeX Developer Note</h2>
 * 
 * Throw this Exception for things like unexpected problems with JAXP and such-like. (E.g. not
 * being able to configure a {@link DocumentBuilderFactory}, unable to find or compile one of
 * the internal XSLT stylesheets...)

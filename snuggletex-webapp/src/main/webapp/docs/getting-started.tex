\section*{Getting Started}

\begin{itemize}

  \item \href[Download]{http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=221375}
        one of the latest binaries ZIP distribution of SnuggleTeX from
        SourceForge.net. There are two binaries available:

        \begin{enumerate}
          \item \verb|snuggletex-n.n.n.zip| is a minimal binary containing
                everything you need for SnuggleTeX's core functionality.

          \item \verb|snuggletex-with-extensions-n.n.n.zip| contains extensions
                for generating legacy ``HTML + image'' output, including required
                required third party JARs.
        \end{enumerate}

        You can also download a source distribution and compile up yourself, if you
        are that way inclined.

  \item Inside the binary distributions, you should find \verb|snuggletex.jar|,
        which is a Java archive containing everything you need to use SnuggleTeX.
        There is also a \verb|src.zip| with the source code for convenience ---
        if you are using an IDE such as Eclipse then you may attach the source
        code to the SnuggleTeX JAR to make it easy to peek in to the source
        code whenever you need to.

  \item Ensure that \verb|snuggletex.jar| is in the ClassPath when compiling
        and running any code that uses SnuggleTeX. (Exactly how you do this depends
        on your development environment.)

\end{itemize}

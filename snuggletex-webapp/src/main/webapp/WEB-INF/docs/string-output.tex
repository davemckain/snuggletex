\section*{XML Strings}

This is the simplest form of SnuggleTeX output. It can be
useful for demonstrating results or if you need to pass or
transmit the resulting XML to other pieces or software.

\subsection*{Usage}

\begin{itemize}

  \item
    The various \verb|SnuggleSession.buildXMLString()| methods create an XML fragment
    (or, more formally, a ``well-formed external general parsed entity'')
    representing everything that has been parsed so far.

  \item
    There are various options for how the XML should be generated and serialized.
    Some of these are controlled via the \verb|DOMOutputOptions| Object that is
    used for the slightly more complex \href[DOM Output]{dom-output.html} case.
\end{itemize}

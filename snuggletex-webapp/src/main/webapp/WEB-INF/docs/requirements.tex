\section*{Software Requirements}

\begin{itemize}

  \item SnuggleTeX requires at least Java 1.5.0, as it makes use of many of the
        nice language features that were added to Java 1.5.

  \item The core SnuggleTeX functionality has no dependencies on
        any other Java libraries so is easy to integrate into Java projects. The
        ``basic'' distribution contains the SnuggleTeX core.

  \item For generating web pages, we recommend the excellent
        \href[SAXON]{http://saxon.sourceforge.net} XSLT processor
        to replace the bundled version of Xalan that comes with the JDK, though
        it is certainly not essential. A recent binary of SAXON is included in
        the full and source distributions of SnuggleTeX.

  \item The module for generating legacy XHTML + images requires some
        JAR files from the \href[JEuclid]{http://jeuclid.sourceforge.net}
        project, which has a number of dependencies on other libraries. A
        suitable set of JARs sufficient to generate PNG images is included in
        the full SnuggleTeX distribution.

  \item The module for generating Content MathML and/or Maxima syntax requires
        the SAXON 9.x processor as it uses XSLT 2.0 to convert the raw Presentation
        MathML produced by SnuggleTeX into other forms. This is included in the
        full SnuggleTeX distribution.
\end{itemize}

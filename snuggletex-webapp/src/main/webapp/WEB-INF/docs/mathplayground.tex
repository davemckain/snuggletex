The \href[SnuggleTeX Math Playground]{http://www2.ph.ed.ac.uk/mathplayground/}
showcases some newer and more experimental uses of SnuggleTeX, and its integration
with existing and emerging "maths on the web" technologies such as
\href[MathJax]{http://www.mathjax.org} and
\href[ASCIIMathML]{http://www1.chapman.edu/~jipsen/mathml/asciimath.html}.

Some of the ideas tried out there will make it into future releases of SnuggleTeX.

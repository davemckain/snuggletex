\pageId{upconversionUsage}

\subsection*{Getting Started}

\begin{itemize}

\item
  In order to use the up-conversion features, you will have to download the full distribution
  of SnuggleTeX.

\item
  You need to have \verb|snuggletex-core.jar| and \verb|snuggletex-upconversion.jar| in
  your ClassPath.

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Example}

Have a look at the source code for
\href[\verb|BasicUpConversionExample.java|]{maven://xref/uk/ac/ed/ph/snuggletex/upconversion/samples/BasicUpConversionExample.html}.
to see how to invoke the up-conversion process.

The key is to hook an \verb|UpConvertingPostProcessor| into the SnuggleTeX DOM-building process using
the \verb|addDOMPostProcessor()| method of your \verb|DOMOutputOptions| or \verb|WebOutputOptions|
Object.

You can configure how the up-conversion process works by passing some
\verb|UpConversionParameters| to your \verb|UpConvertingPostProcesor|.

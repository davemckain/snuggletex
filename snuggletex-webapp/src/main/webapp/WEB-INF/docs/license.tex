\subsection*{Licenses for Included Software}

The full ZIP bundle of SnuggleTeX includes some third-party software

up-conversion and JEuclid
extensions. (See the \href[Getting Started]{docs://gettingstarted}
page for more details on when this software is required.) If you use
these features, then
you are encouraged to check the licensing of these software components
as well:

    <h2>Release Notes</h2>

    <h3>Version 1.0.0-beta2 (??/05/08)</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Distribution ZIPs now package all files into a single base directory, which
        is more convenient for users.
      </li>
      <li>
        Binary ZIP distribution now contains a <tt>src.zip</tt> file containing the
        SnuggleTeX source code (excluding classes for the test suite and demonstration
        webapp) as a convenience for users of IDEs such as Eclipse.
      </li>
      <li>
        MathML annotations are now generated correctly (when requested)
      </li>
      <li>
        Added support for <tt>\hspace</tt> (and <tt>\hspace*</tt>, though without its
        proper LaTeX semantics), including all units supported by LaTeX plus the
        <tt>em</tt> amd <tt>ex</tt> units commonly used on the web.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fixed an obscure bug when trying to generate XHTML errors for errors occurring
        within a MathML element that has no parent XHTML element.
      </li>
      <li>
        Certain math operators (e.g. summation) now generate limits using <tt>munder</tt>
        and friends rather than <tt>msub</tt> et al when used in displaymath mode.
      </li>
    </ul>

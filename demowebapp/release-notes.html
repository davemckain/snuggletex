    <h2>Release Notes</h2>

    <h3>Version 1.0.0-beta5 [r???] (??/07/08)</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Fixed rendering issue with the <tt>array</tt> environment that was causing
        later tokens to be handled wrongly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fixed handling of negative numbers, so that <tt>$1-2$</tt> is treated
        correctly as a subtraction and not the numbers 1 and -2 juxtaposed(!)
      </li>
      <li>
        Added Java API documentation generation to the build process, which
        puts it in the demo webapp.
      </li>
      <li>
        Improved <tt>LaTeXTokeniser</tt> to allow built-in environments containing
        <tt>VERBATIM</tt> content, which generalises the existing support for the
        standard LaTeX <tt>verbatim</tt> environment and is now in line with existing
        support for similar content within command arguments.
      </li>
      <li>
        Minor changes to web headers and footers ahead of rename of "School of Physics"
        to "School of Physics and Astronomy".
      </li>
      <li>
        Simplified the use of "default" configurations and options in <tt>SnuggleTeXEngine</tt>
        and <tt>SnuggleTeXSession</tt>. Also fixed a bug in the application of such options
        in <tt>SnuggleTeXSession.buildXMLString()</tt>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Moved (still experimental) feature for optionally down-transforming simple MathML
        expressions into plain old XHTML + CSS from Aardvark, where it had been incubating.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Version 1.0.0-beta4 [r102] (25/06/08)</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Further improvements to the output of the <tt>MessageFormatter</tt> when reporting
        the results of large substitutions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fixed bug in handling edge case inputs like <tt>{\rm}</tt>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fixed silly edge case bug when handling trivial <tt>tabular</tt> environments.
      </li>
      <li>
        Added support for <tt>\aa</tt> and <tt>\AA</tt>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Improved handling of <tt>\rm</tt> and <tt>\textrm</tt> so that they can be used
        in MATH mode. The former behaves in the same way as <tt>\mathrm</tt>; the latter
        behaves like <tt>\mbox{\mathrm{...}}</tt>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Added support for <tt>|</tt>, <tt>&lt;</tt> and <tt>&gt;</tt> as bracket
        operators compatible with <tt>\left</tt> and <tt>\right</tt>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Added support for having trailing <tt>\</tt> on lines, behaving as in LaTeX.
        (I.e. effectively concatenating the two lines with a '<tt>\ </tt>' command.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Fixed bug in matching up curly and square brackets when the content contains
        a LaTeX comment containing close brackets. These were being counted as balancers,
        rather than being ignored.
      </li>
      <li>
        Simple commands were being too zealous in absorbing trailing whitespace by also
        stripping newlines. Now fixed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Corrected the output of <tt>mtext</tt> in that leading and trailing
        whitespace is now added as separate <tt>mspace</tt> elements.
      </li>
      <li>
        Added support for <tt>\stackrel</tt>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Added support for the <tt>array</tt> environment.
      </li>
      <li>
        Added convenience method to <tt>SnuggleTeXSession</tt> that can create a
        standalone <tt>NodeList</tt> inside a fresh <tt>Document</tt>, which
        can be sometimes be useful.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fixed bug in the reporting of the start index of a dollar math environment.
      </li>
      <li>
        The <tt>eqnarray*</tt> environment and friends now generate MathML annotations
        (if requested).
      </li>
      <li>
        Added some new static methods to <tt>SnuggleTeX</tt>, such as some convenience methods
        for driving web page generation and a method for extracting a SnuggleTeX annotation
        from a created MathML <tt>math</tt> element (providing annotation generating is
        turned on, of course).
      </li>
      <li>
        Added support for handling <tt>\mathcal</tt>, <tt>\mathsc</tt>,<tt>\mathbb</tt> and <tt>\mathfrak</tt>
        by adding a <tt>mathvariant</tt> attribute to resulting MathML identifier elements. This
        in its own isn't always enough (e.g. default Firefox) so I've also added extra support for
        mapping (safe) Unicode characters to alternative characters in much the same way as
        existing tools. This can be turned on in <tt>DOMBuilderOptions</tt>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Added support for <tt>\ensuremath</tt>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Added support for the optional argument in <tt>\msqrt</tt>. I had completely forgotten
        about this before!
      </li>
      <li>
        Slightly improved sample pages in the documentation.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <hr />

    <h3>Version 1.0.0-beta3 [r76] (29/05/08)</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Fixed silly bug in the handling of multi-line <tt>verbatim</tt> environments.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fixed bug in the recording of the slices of compound tokens, introduced by
        an earlier over-simplification to how this all worked.
      </li>
      <li>
        Added belated support for <tt>\!</tt>. Need to test browser support for this...
      </li>
      <li>
        Fixed handling of <tt>\hline</tt> inside tabular environments. I had forgotten that
        this explicitly starts a new row!
      </li>
      <li>
        Added support for verbatim-mode arguments in built-in commands and environments.
        (We don't support having verbatim-mode content for environments yet, apart from
        the usual <tt>verbatim</tt> environment.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Added special <tt>\href</tt> macro to make it easy to create a hypertext link
        with optional link text. (This may change before 1.0.0)
      </li>
      <li>
        Added <tt>\xmlName</tt> command which takes a single argument (in verbatim mode)
        and verifies that it is a proper XML Name.
      </li>
      <li>
        Improved information provided by <tt>MessageFormatter</tt> class when expanding
        out error messages.
      </li>
      <li>
        Added support for <tt>\vert</tt> and <tt>\Vert</tt>, both as standalone operators
        and as combiners for <tt>\left</tt> and <tt>\right</tt>. Changed the way math
        bracket operators are represented internally to accommodate this as these are
        the first examples where the openers and closers are identical, hence can't be
        inferred.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Version 1.0.0-beta2 [r57] (20/05/08)</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Distribution ZIPs now package all files into a single base directory, which
        is more convenient for users.
      </li>
      <li>
        Binary ZIP distribution now contains a <tt>src.zip</tt> file containing the
        SnuggleTeX source code (excluding classes for the test suite and demonstration
        webapp) as a convenience for users of IDEs such as Eclipse.
      </li>
      <li>
        MathML annotations are now generated correctly (when requested)
      </li>
      <li>
        Added support for <tt>\hspace</tt> (and <tt>\hspace*</tt>, though without its
        proper LaTeX semantics), including all units supported by LaTeX plus the
        <tt>em</tt> amd <tt>ex</tt> units commonly used on the web.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fixed an obscure bug when trying to generate XHTML errors for errors occurring
        within a MathML element that has no parent XHTML element.
      </li>
      <li>
        Certain math operators (e.g. summation) now generate limits using <tt>munder</tt>
        and friends rather than <tt>msub</tt> et al when used in displaymath mode.
      </li>
      <li>
        Added support for <tt>--</tt> and <tt>---</tt>, which result in the appropriate Unicode
        dash characters.
      </li>
      <li>
        The <tt>\verb</tt> command now replaces spaces with non-breaking spaces in its output.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Release Notes</h2>

    <h3>Version 1.0.0-beta4 [r??] (??/06/08)</h3>

    <hr />

    <h3>Version 1.0.0-beta3 [r76] (29/05/08)</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Fixed silly bug in the handling of multi-line <tt>verbatim</tt> environments.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fixed bug in the recording of the slices of compound tokens, introduced by
        an earlier over-simplification to how this all worked.
      </li>
      <li>
        Added belated support for <tt>\!</tt>. Need to test browser support for this...
      </li>
      <li>
        Fixed handling of <tt>\hline</tt> inside tabular environments. I had forgotten that
        this explicitly starts a new row!
      </li>
      <li>
        Added support for verbatim-mode arguments in built-in commands and environments.
        (We don't support having verbatim-mode content for environments yet, apart from
        the usual <tt>verbatim</tt> environment.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Added special <tt>\href</tt> macro to make it easy to create a hypertext link
        with optional link text. (This may change before 1.0.0)
      </li>
      <li>
        Added <tt>\xmlName</tt> command which takes a single argument (in verbatim mode)
        and verifies that it is a proper XML Name.
      </li>
      <li>
        Improved information provided by <tt>MessageFormatter</tt> class when expanding
        out error messages.
      </li>
      <li>
        Added support for <tt>\vert</tt> and <tt>\Vert</tt>, both as standalone operators
        and as combiners for <tt>\left</tt> and <tt>\right</tt>. Changed the way math
        bracket operators are represented internally to accommodate this as these are
        the first examples where the openers and closers are identical, hence can't be
        inferred.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Version 1.0.0-beta2 [r57] (20/05/08)</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Distribution ZIPs now package all files into a single base directory, which
        is more convenient for users.
      </li>
      <li>
        Binary ZIP distribution now contains a <tt>src.zip</tt> file containing the
        SnuggleTeX source code (excluding classes for the test suite and demonstration
        webapp) as a convenience for users of IDEs such as Eclipse.
      </li>
      <li>
        MathML annotations are now generated correctly (when requested)
      </li>
      <li>
        Added support for <tt>\hspace</tt> (and <tt>\hspace*</tt>, though without its
        proper LaTeX semantics), including all units supported by LaTeX plus the
        <tt>em</tt> amd <tt>ex</tt> units commonly used on the web.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fixed an obscure bug when trying to generate XHTML errors for errors occurring
        within a MathML element that has no parent XHTML element.
      </li>
      <li>
        Certain math operators (e.g. summation) now generate limits using <tt>munder</tt>
        and friends rather than <tt>msub</tt> et al when used in displaymath mode.
      </li>
      <li>
        Added support for <tt>--</tt> and <tt>---</tt>, which result in the appropriate Unicode
        dash characters.
      </li>
    </ul>

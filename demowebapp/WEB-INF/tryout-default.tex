\section*{Welcome to SnuggleTeX!}

\begin{itemize}
  \item This is an itemized list.

  \item This is some inline maths: $x^2+ y^2 = 1$

  \item Some block maths:
        \[ \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2} = \frac{\pi^2}{6} \]
        (\em{Note}: This currently doesn't display too nicely in Firefox 3. Boo\ldots)

  \item A matrix:
        \[ A = \left( \begin{array}{cc} 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4 \end{array} \right) \]

\end{itemize}

Here is an example of a SnuggleTeX error message. You can set it up to display the messages inline (as we have here) or report them in various other ways:

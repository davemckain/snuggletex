SnuggleTeX is a free and open-source Java library for converting a
reasonable subset of LaTeX to XML (made of standards-compliant XHTML and MathML).
It is primarily intended for use by applications requiring this type of
functionality, but can also be used to generate standalone web pages very
easily.

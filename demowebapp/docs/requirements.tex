\section*{Software Requirements}

\begin{itemize}

  \item Using the SnuggleTeX in your own Java projects requires that you have
        Java 1.5.0 or above, since it makes use of many of the language
        features that were added to Java 1.5.

  \item The SnuggleTeX "core" currently has no dependencies on any other Java
        libraries so is easy to integrate into Java projects.

  \item For generating web pages, the SAXON XSLT processor is recommended. A
        recent binary of SAXON is included in the full and source distributions
        of SnuggleTeX.

  \item The extension for generating HTML + images output requires the
        JEuclid library, which has a number of dependencies on other
        libraries. A minimal set of these required to generate PNG images
        is included in the SnuggleTeX distribution.

\end{itemize}

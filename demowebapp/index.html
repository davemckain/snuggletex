    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>
      SnuggleTeX is a free and open-source Java library for converting a
      reasonable subset of LaTeX to standards-compliant XHTML+MathML. It is
      primarily intended for use by applications requiring this type of
      functionality, but can also be used to generate standalone web pages very
      easily.
    </p>

    <h2>Features</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        SnuggleTeX is a 100% Java library with no dependencies on any other Java libraries.
      </li>
      <li>
        Converts a good subset of (media-agnostic) LaTeX into XML.
      </li>
      <li>
        Supports <tt>\newcommand</tt> and <tt>\newenvironment</tt> and friends, making it
        easy to create custom commands and environments. (There are also lower-level
        Java hooks for defining new commands and environments.)
      </li>
      <li>
        SnuggleTeX has optional features for inferring limited semantics in
        certain mathematical expressions, such as automatically fencing matched
        brackets and inserting "apply function" and "invisible times" operators
        into simple algebraic expressions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Output can either be a DOM fragment or a standalone web page.
      </li>
      <li>
        Web page outputs can be configured in various ways and a there are a
        number of preset "page types" that support the most common ways that XHTML+MathML
        content can be deployed on the web.
      </li>
      <li>
        Outputs can be fully standalone (e.g. with all styling done inline) to enable
        page fragments to be imported into other systems which support XHTML+MathML.
      </li>
      <li>
        Error reporting is configurable and error messages are internationalisable and
        provide detailed contextual information.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Usage Guide</h2>

    <p>
      This will appear on the Wiki soon... In the mean time, there are examples within
      the source code which you can check out from SourceForge.net.

    <h2>LaTeX Guide &amp; Samples</h2>

    <p>
      The pages linked below show some examples of the LaTeX commands that are supported
      and the outputs expected. It also demonstrates some of the preset web page types that
      can be generated.

    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> You must have a browser capable of viewing MathML. Use
      either Firefox or Internet Explorer 6/7 with the freely available MathPlayer plug-in.

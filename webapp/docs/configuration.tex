\section*{Configuration}

SnuggleTeX offers a number of way of controlling how it works in various
ways.

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Parsing Configuration}: Create a \verb|SessionConfiguration| Objects to control
  aspects of the parsing process. Each \verb|SnuggleSession| can have
  its own configuration, independent of others. You can also set a default
  configuration for a \verb|SnuggleEngine|.

\item \textbf{Output Configuration}: Various "Options" Objects exist for the different
  types of outputs. See \href[Outputs]{outputs.html} for more information.

\item \textbf{Command Definitions}: SnuggleTeX supports \verb|\newcommand|,
  \verb|\newenvironment| and friends, allowing your inputs to define new commands
  and environments as and when required. You can also define commands and environments
  programmatically and pass them to your \verb|SnuggleEngine|.

\end{itemize}

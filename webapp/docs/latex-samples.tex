\section*{Web Output Samples}

For maximum portability --- and to ensure that search engines
cope with them --- these documentation pages have
been generated using the
\href[Legacy XHTML + Images Web Page Output]{outputs.html#legacy},
which do not actually contain any MathML!

To allow you to see the different MathML-based views in
action, the links below show different versions of the
``\href[Basic Math Mode Commands]{math-mode.html}'' page
generated using some of other web output page types
described in the \href[Outputs]{outputs.html} page.

Of course, not all of these will display in all browsers.
You should look at the \href[Outputs]{outputs.html}
and \href[Browser Requirements]{browser-requirements.html}
pages for more information.

\begin{itemize}

  \item \href[MOZILLA]{math-mode.xhtml} (\href[about this view]{outputs.html#mozilla})

  \item \href[UNIVERSAL\_STYLESHEET]{math-mode.xml} (\href[about this view]{outputs.html#uss})

  \item \href[MATHPLAYER\_HTML]{math-mode.htm} (\href[about this view]{outputs.html#mathplayer})

  \item \href[CROSS\_BROWSER\_XML]{math-mode.cxml} (\href[about this view]{outputs.html#crossbrowser})

\end{itemize}

(If you are that way inclined, you can also look at other views of other pages
in this documentation bundle by playing around with the file extensions in the same
way as above; you can also use the \verb|.tex| extension to see the original SnuggleTeX
source for a page.)

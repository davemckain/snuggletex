\section*{Release Notes}

\subsection*{Version 1.0.0-beta5 [r???] (??/07/08)}

\begin{itemize}

  \item Fixed rendering issue with the \verb|array| environment that was
  causing later tokens to be handled wrongly.

  \item Fixed handling of negative numbers, so that \verb|$1-2$| is treated
  correctly as a subtraction and not the numbers 1 and -2 juxtaposed(!)

  \item Added Java API documentation generation to the build process, which
  puts it in the demo webapp.

  \item Improved \verb|LaTeXTokeniser| to allow built-in environments
  containing \verb|VERBATIM| content, which generalises the existing support
  for the standard LaTeX \verb|verbatim| environment and is now in line with
  existing support for similar content within command arguments.

  \item Minor changes to web headers and footers ahead of rename of "School of
  Physics" to "School of Physics and Astronomy".

  \item Simplified the use of "default" configurations and options in
  \verb|SnuggleEngine| and \verb|SnuggleSession|. Also fixed a bug in the
  application of such options in \verb|SnuggleSession.buildXMLString()|.

  \item Moved (still experimental) feature for optionally down-transforming
  simple MathML expressions into plain old XHTML + CSS from Aardvark, where it
  had been incubating.

  \item Moved (still experimental) extension for creating "legacy" HTML +
  images web pages, using the JEuclid package to convert MathML to images.

  \item Added \verb|LinkMapper| class and support for associating a URL with a
  \verb|SnuggleInput|, allowing hypertext links to be intercepted and remapped
  if necessary.

  \item Updated web page generation so that any supplied XSLT stylesheets are
  applied before \verb|createWebPage()| returns.

  \item \verb|MathMLWebPageBuilder| now checks whether the serializing XSLT
  created via TrAX is a version of SAXON supporting XSLT 2.0 and, if so,
  uses the \verb|xhtml| output method rather than \verb.html| when appropriate.

  \item Refactored and updated the documentation pages significantly.

  \item Renamed \verb|WebPageType.DEFAULT| as \verb|WebPageType.MOZILLA|.

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Version 1.0.0-beta4 [r102] (25/06/08)}

\begin{itemize}

  \item Further improvements to the output of the \verb|MessageFormatter| when
  reporting the results of large substitutions.

  \item Fixed bug in handling edge case inputs like \verb|{\rm}|.

  \item Fixed silly edge case bug when handling trivial \verb|tabular|
  environments.

  \item Added support for \verb|\aa| and \verb|\AA|.

  \item Improved handling of \verb|\rm| and \verb|\textrm| so that they can be
  used in MATH mode. The former behaves in the same way as \verb|\mathrm|; the
  latter behaves like \verb|\mbox{\mathrm{...}}|.

  \item Added support for \verb|||, \verb|<| and \verb|>| as bracket operators
  compatible with \verb|\left| and \verb|\right|.

  \item Added support for having trailing \verb|\| on lines, behaving as in
  LaTeX.  (I.e. effectively concatenating the two lines with a '\verb|\ |'
  command.)

  \item Fixed bug in matching up curly and square brackets when the content
  contains a LaTeX comment containing close brackets. These were being counted
  as balancers, rather than being ignored.

  \item Simple commands were being too zealous in absorbing trailing whitespace
  by also stripping newlines. Now fixed.

  \item Corrected the output of \verb|mtext| in that leading and trailing
  whitespace is now added as separate \verb|mspace| elements.

  \item Added support for \verb|\stackrel|.

  \item Added support for the \verb|array| environment.

  \item Added convenience method to \verb|SnuggleSession| that can create a
  standalone \verb|NodeList| inside a fresh \verb|Document|, which can be
  sometimes be useful.

  \item Fixed bug in the reporting of the start index of a dollar math
  environment.

  \item The \verb|eqnarray*| environment and friends now generate MathML
  annotations (if requested).

  \item Added some new static methods to \verb|SnuggleTeX|, such as some
  convenience methods for driving web page generation and a method for
  extracting a SnuggleTeX annotation from a created MathML \verb|math| element
  (providing annotation generating is turned on, of course).

  \item Added support for handling \verb|\mathcal|,
  \verb|\mathsc|,\verb|\mathbb| and \verb|\mathfrak| by adding a
  \verb|mathvariant| attribute to resulting MathML identifier elements. This in
  its own isn't always enough (e.g. default Firefox) so I've also added extra
  support for mapping (safe) Unicode characters to alternative characters in
  much the same way as existing tools. This can be turned on in
  \verb|DOMOutputOptions|.

  \item Added support for \verb|\ensuremath|.

  \item Added support for the optional argument in \verb|\msqrt|. I had
  completely forgotten about this before!

  \item Slightly improved sample pages in the documentation.

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Version 1.0.0-beta3 [r76] (29/05/08)}

\begin{itemize}

  \item Fixed silly bug in the handling of multi-line \verb|verbatim|
  environments.

  \item Fixed bug in the recording of the slices of compound tokens, introduced
  by an earlier over-simplification to how this all worked.

  \item Added belated support for \verb|\!|. Need to test browser support for
  this...

  \item Fixed handling of \verb|\hline| inside tabular environments. I had
  forgotten that this explicitly starts a new row!

  \item Added support for verbatim-mode arguments in built-in commands and
  environments.  (We don't support having verbatim-mode content for
  environments yet, apart from the usual \verb|verbatim| environment.)

  \item Added special \verb|\href| macro to make it easy to create a hypertext
  link with optional link text. (This may change before 1.0.0)

  \item Added \verb|.htmlName| command which takes a single argument (in
  verbatim mode) and verifies that it is a proper XML Name.

  \item Improved information provided by \verb|MessageFormatter| class when
  expanding out error messages.

  \item Added support for \verb|\vert| and \verb|\Vert|, both as standalone
  operators and as combiners for \verb|\left| and \verb|\right|. Changed the
  way math bracket operators are represented internally to accommodate this as
  these are the first examples where the openers and closers are identical,
  hence can't be inferred.

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Version 1.0.0-beta2 [r57] (20/05/08)}

\begin{itemize}

  \item Distribution ZIPs now package all files into a single base directory,
  which is more convenient for users.

  \item Binary ZIP distribution now contains a \verb|src.zip| file containing
  the SnuggleTeX source code (excluding classes for the test suite and
  demonstration webapp) as a convenience for users of IDEs such as Eclipse.

  \item MathML annotations are now generated correctly (when requested)

  \item Added support for \verb|\hspace| (and \verb|\hspace*|, though without
  its proper LaTeX semantics), including all units supported by LaTeX plus the
  \verb|em| amd \verb|ex| units commonly used on the web.

  \item Fixed an obscure bug when trying to generate XHTML errors for errors
  occurring within a MathML element that has no parent XHTML element.

  \item Certain math operators (e.g. summation) now generate limits using
  \verb|munder| and friends rather than \verb|msub| et al when used in
  displaymath mode.

  \item Added support for \verb|--| and \verb|---|, which result in the
  appropriate Unicode dash characters.

  \item The \verb|\verb| command now replaces spaces with non-breaking spaces
  in its output.

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Version 1.0.0-beta1 [r42] (13/05/08)}

First public beta release.

\section*{Software Requirements}

\subsection*{Overview}

\begin{itemize}

  \item SnuggleTeX requires at least Java 1.5.0, as it makes use of many of the
        nice language features that were added to Java 1.5.

  \item The SnuggleTeX "core" functionality currently has no dependencies on
        any other Java libraries so is easy to integrate into Java projects. The
        standard binary distribution contains the SnuggleTeX core.

  \item For generating web pages, we recommend the excellent
        \href[SAXON]{http://saxon.sourceforge.net} XSLT processor
        to replace the bundled version of Xalan that comes with the JDK, though
        it is cetainly not essential. A recent binary of SAXON is included in
        the full and source distributions of SnuggleTeX.

  \item The extension for generating legacy XHTML + images requires the
        \href[JEuclid]{http://jeuclid.sourceforge.net}
        library, which has a number of dependencies on other libraries. A
        minimal set of those sufficient to generate PNG images is included in
        the full SnuggleTeX distribution.

  \item The SnuggleTeX source distribution includes
        \href[JUnit4]{http://www.junit.org} and
        \href[EasyMock]{http://www.easymock.org} libraries
        for running the SnuggleTeX test suite.

\end{itemize}

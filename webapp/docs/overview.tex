\section*{Overview}

SnuggleTeX is a free and open-source Java library for converting fragments
of LaTeX to XML (usually XHTML + MathML).

\subsection*{Goals}

SnuggleTeX was initially developed to facilitate that conversion of snippets of
LaTeX into XHTML and MathML islands within the more complex XML structures
representing the various types of Content Objects found within the
\href[Aardvark Course Content Managment
System]{http://www.ph.ed.ac.uk/elearning/projects/aardvark/}.

SnuggleTeX can also generate standalone web pages very easily and it supports a
number of "templates" to help create XHTML + MathML tailored for particular
browser audiences.

The software is primarily aimed at Java developers looking for a LaTeX to XML
conversion solution they can easily integrate into their software.

\subsection*{License}

SnuggleTeX is issued under a liberal 2-clause BSD license and is
available for download in source and binary packages.

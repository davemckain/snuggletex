/**
 * Simple demonstration of how to use some of the utilities within SnuggleTeX to up-convert
 * some raw MathML extracted from ASCIIMathML.
 * <p>
 * (You can do the same with the raw MathML produced by SnuggleTeX as well; you just have to
 * call a {@link MathMLUpConverter#upConvertSnuggleTeXMathML(Document, UpConversionOptions)}) instead of the
 * method for SnuggleTeX. When using SnuggleTeX normally, all of this can be invoked during
 * the snuggling process by adding a {@link UpConvertingPostProcessor} to the List returned
 * by {@link DOMOutputOptions#getDOMPostProcessors()}.)
 * 
 * <h2>Running Notes</h2>
 * 
 * You will need the following in your ClassPath:
 * 
 * <ul>
 *   <li>snuggletex-core.jar</li>
 *   <li>snuggletex-upconversion.jar</li>
 *   <li>saxon9.jar, saxon9-dom.jar</li> (These are required as the conversion process uses XSLT 2.0)
 * </ul>
 * 
 * If you're already using XSLT 1.0 in your application and <strong>don't</strong> want your
 * existing XSLT to run using SAXON (which is hard to justify, IMO, as SAXON is superior to other
 * XSLT processors in most respects) then you might find that SAXON becomes your JAXP default
 * processor, which you can override as you require as it is invoked here explicitly, rather than
 * using {@link TransformerFactory#newInstance()}.
 *
